		  <p> was created as my Capstone project for <b><a href="http://www.appacademy.io">App Academy</a></b>, an intensive web development bootcamp in San Francisco.  The inspiration for this project came from a desire to spend less time waiting for Bart trains and more time improving my coding skills.

		  Bart-Live is a Ruby on Rails based app utilizing a PostgreSQL database and deployed with GIT via Heroku.  On the front end, this app uses Javascript, Twitter Bootstrap, CSS, JQuery, and Ajax to create the (awesome) user interface.  In case you're curious, here's how some of the features of this application work:

		  <p>The departure times are pulled from the official Bart API by my Rails server when you click on a station.  The closest station finder uses HTML 5's built in geolocation in conjunction with the Google Places API (location services must be enabled on your browser for this feature to function).  Text reminders are stored in the database using Delayed Job, and sent using Twilio's SMS messaging API.  Data presentation is handled with JQuery and Ajax to avoid page reloads for most requests which gives the app a single page feel.  Check back regularly for new features.

		Hopefully, my app will come in handy and save you some time when commuting. I also hope it will help showcase my development skills.
